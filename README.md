# Elegant FinRL

  This project borrows ideas from [ElegantRL](https://github.com/Yonv1943/ElegantRL) and [FinRL](https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library)
  
  We aim to maintain a lightweight, efficient and stable DRL lib.
  
  **Lightweight** less than 1,000 code lines; using PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, and NumPy.
  
  **Efficient** We expect its performance to be comparable with Ray RLlib.
  
  **Stable** We expect it is stable as Stable Baseline 3.
  
  
  
# Deign Principles

  **Be Pythonic** Quant traders, data scientists and machine learning engineers are familiar with the open source Python ecosystem: its programming model, and its tools, e.g., NumPy.
